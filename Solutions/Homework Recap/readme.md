1-  Write definitions of functions for:

sphereArea(radius) Returns the surface area of a sphere having the given radius
sphereVolume(radius) Returns the volume of a sphere having the given radius
sumN(n) Returns the sum of the n natural numbers
toNumbers(strList) str is a list of strings, each which represents a number. Modify each entry in the list by converting it into a number. hint use :int()

2- Using functions that you  created above and in 4/10/19 class  create a  program that  computes the sum of the squares of numbers read from a file. Also include a main method where you ask the user to input the name of the file.
